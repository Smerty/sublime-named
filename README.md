This plugin requires the utility 'named-checkzone' to be installed and available on the path.

*The zonename must match the zone file's name (e.g, zonename example.com contained in the file example.com.zone)*

### Usage
Tools -> Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `zonecheck`.
